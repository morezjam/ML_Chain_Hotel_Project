# ML_Chain_Hotel_Project

Using different ML algorithms to measure profitability of a chain hotel branch in a specific location (solving classification and a regression problem).

This project was an assignment project of the CE802 module at the University of Essex delivered by Professor Luca Citi. Please Note that:

**Dataset files and Project definition are credited to the University of Essex and the lecturer of the module Professor Luca Citi.**

This project also includes some data preprocessing stages and some techniques in training and testing of the model such as pipelining and hyperparameter tuning using Scikit-learn.

"CE802_P2_Notebook" tackles the classification problem that whether the hotel is profitable or not.

"CE802_P3_Notebook" addresses the regression problem of estimating the amount of profit that the new branch may possibly make.

The dataset for each task of the project have been provided in CSV format.

# Core libraries used in the project

Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, LightGBM, and Matplotlib.

# Project Report

the pilot-study pdf file clarifies detail on the type of predictiv task that needs to be performed, examples of informative features as predictors, selection of the learning procedure and the reason for the choice, and describing the way to test the trained model.

the report pdf file gives more information on the classification and regression task.
